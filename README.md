# World Population Data Visualizer

This is a simple web application built with Streamlit, that performs web scraping and visualization of Wikipedia world population data. The application displays the data in two ways: 

- Population by Region: Displays the total population of each region in the world.
- Population by Country: Displays the population of each country in the world.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the app using the following command: `streamlit run app.py`.
4. The app will open in your default browser.

## Libraries Used

- `base64`: For encoding and decoding CSV files.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `streamlit`: For building the web application.
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization.

## Data Source

The data was obtained from the following Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population.

## Acknowledgments

This application was created as part of a project to practice web scraping and data visualization with Python. Special thanks to the Streamlit team for creating such an amazing library.
